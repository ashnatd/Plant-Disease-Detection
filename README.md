# Plant-Disease-Detection
/b Overview
The Plant Leaf Disease Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves using image data. The project utilizes Python along with libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning and image classification. The system can be applied to help farmers and agricultural professionals identify diseases early, potentially reducing crop damage and improving yield.

Features
Image Classification: The model classifies different plant diseases based on images of leaves.
Deep Learning: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate image-based disease classification.
User-Friendly: Simple interface for uploading images and viewing results.
Preprocessing: Includes image augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains thousands of images of plant leaves, both healthy and infected. It includes images of various types of diseases affecting different plant species. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to enrich the training dataset.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Core programming language used in the project.
TensorFlow/Keras: Framework for building and training the deep learning model.
OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing and augmentation.
NumPy, Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis libraries.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries used for visualizing the data and results.
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment for running Python code.
